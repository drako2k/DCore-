# Dcore 2.0
A sleek, dark Discord theme featuring a high-contrast, cyber-style background with dynamic streaks of black, white, and red. The transparent interface allows the energetic backdrop to show through while maintaining clear readability across channels, messages, and the member list. Bold, modern, and visually striking — a polished futuristic UI aesthetic.
> This is a remake of the original ClearVision theme by [ClearVision](https://github.com/ClearVision/).
